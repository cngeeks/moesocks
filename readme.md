MoeSocks
========


A socks5 proxy using the client / server architecture.

MoeSocks is greatly inspired by [shadowsocks].

A sample `config.json` file is included in this repository and the cabal archive.

type `moesocks --help` for help.

* Note: currently there is still a bug in remote mode, client mode is fully
  usable.
